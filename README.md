# KOTH
Python utilities to help with inter-language "King of the Hill" style coding challenges, where participants create "bots" (scripts) to compete in some challenge.

## Script interaction
A very simple system to interact with the bot scripts whatever language they may be in, via stdin and stdout. Still in development, but please do contribute a wrapper in your favourite language to `KOTH/src/clients` called `client.{ext}` where `{ext}` is your language's conventional source code extension, eg. `py` or `js`. Documentation to come.
