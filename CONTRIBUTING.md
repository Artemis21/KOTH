# Contributing to KOTH
If you're reading this, you're probably thinking about contributing. Thank you! Here are some guidelines to stick to to improve your code's chances of being accepted:
### General guidlines:
 - **Include a helpful commit message.** This makes it easier to see what your improvement does, and why it should be included.
 - **Conform to PEP 8.** Make sure your code follows the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This makes it easier for others to read your code and add to it.
 - **Document your code.** Include comments and docstrings where appropriate to help others understand your code. As a bonus, explain your improvement in the wiki!
 - **Don't duplicate features.** If a utility already provides a way of doing something, don't provide another way!
### Contributing to an existing utility:
 - **Don't change the coding style.** Other than to improve it, or make sure it conforms to PEP8, please leave others' code as-is. This shows respect for their work, and minimises the changes to look through.
 - **Don't make breaking changes.** Do: fix bugs and typos, optimise code, improve cross-platform support and add features. Don't: change how old features are used or remove old features.
### Adding new utilities
 - **Don't add a new utility if you don't need to.** Make sure there's not another utility it would make more sense to add to.
 - **Don't put a single file in it's own folder.** Unless you plan on adding more files to the utility, just put single-file utilities in KOTH/koth.
